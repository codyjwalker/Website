            <h1>About:</h1>
            <p>
                I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of 
                Arizona with a minor in Mathematics in May 2019. I'm searching 
                for an internship or entry-level position in programming, 
                software engineering, computer science, or a related field 
                where I can continue to enhance my expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always had a huge interest in mathematics and physics, and
                philosophy since I was young, and ever since I first began
                developing software I quickly gained a massive passion for it
                as well.  I'm about to move to the Greater Denver area and am
                searching for a full-time job or internship there where I can
                utilize my skills to further develop my skillset, build my
                experience, and be a part of a team contributing to a large
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love almost any activity that you can do outdoors.  This
                includes camping, hunting, hiking, fishing, dirtbiking,
                longboarding, backpacking, and many others.  I achieved the
                ranking of Eagle Scout in 2011, and always enjoy utilizing
                the skills I learned during Scouting.  I traveled to Japan
                for 11 days, and once spent five nights in Havasupai Falls,
                Grand Canyon.  Someday I would love to see Zion and
                Yosemite, and would also love to experience backpacking
                around Europe, but I always love the opportunity for a new
                adventure and am excited for whatever is to come!
